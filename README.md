This repo contains the assessment problem statements during my internship and my solution to the problem. Freshmen who are looking for internships can get an idea of how internship work. 


<br>
<br>

My internships are in:
- Bash
- Image processing
- Restful-API


<br>

    Note: 
        I have only attached the assessment questions and my code. 
        The code written for production is not shared. 
        This is not the default assessment procedure and may differ between companies.
